# PayFlow — Distributed Payment Platform

A production-grade distributed payment platform simulating a real-world fintech backend. Built with Java 21, Spring Boot 3, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Redis using microservices, event-driven architecture, and distributed systems patterns.

> Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate senior backend engineering practices: distributed transactions, event-driven design, resiliency patterns, and production-grade observability.

## Implemented Patterns

| Pattern | Where | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| **Choreography Saga** | payment → wallet → fraud → notification | Distributed transaction without 2PC |
| **Transactional Outbox** | payment-service | Atomic DB write + Kafka publish, no dual-write risk |
| **Pessimistic Locking** | wallet-service | `SELECT FOR UPDATE` prevents race conditions on balance |
| **Idempotency Keys** | payment-service (HTTP), wallet-service (reserve/settle/release) | Safe retries without double-charges |
| **Dead Letter Queue** | All Kafka consumers | Failed messages preserved for ops inspection |
| **ExponentialBackOff** | All Kafka consumers | 1s → 2s → 4s before DLQ |
| **JWT Authentication** | api-gateway (validation) + auth-service (issuance) | Stateless auth, 15m access / 7d refresh |
| **Rate Limiting** | api-gateway + Redis | Token bucket per client |
| **Circuit Breaker** | payment → wallet HTTP calls | Resilience4j (Phase 6+) |
| **Distributed Tracing** | All services | W3C trace context, Brave → Zipkin |
| **Structured Logging** | All services | JSON via logstash-logback-encoder, traceId in every line |

| auth-service | 8081 | `/swagger-ui.html` | User registration, login, JWT + refresh token lifecycle |
| payment-service | 8082 | `/swagger-ui.html` | Transaction creation and saga orchestration |
| wallet-service | 8083 | `/swagger-ui.html` | Balance reservation, settlement, pessimistic locking |
| fraud-service | 8084 | — | Asynchronous risk analysis via Kafka |
| notification-service | 8085 | — | Email/push notification delivery |

## Kafka Topics

![Kafka Event Flow](docs/images/kafka-topics.png)

| Topic | Partitions | Producer | Consumers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fraud-analysis-requested` | 6 | payment-service | fraud-service |
| `fraud-analysis-completed` | 6 | fraud-service | payment-service |
| `payment-approved` | 6 | payment-service | notification-service |
| `payment-rejected` | 6 | payment-service | notification-service |
| `*.DLQ` | 1 | consumers (on failure) | ops alerting |

Partition key: `paymentId` — guarantees ordering for all events belonging to the same payment.

## Payment Flow

![Payment Sequence](docs/images/payment-happy-path.png)

```
1.  POST /api/auth/login                 → access_token (JWT, 15m TTL)
2.  POST /api/payments  {idempotencyKey} → 202 PENDING_FRAUD_REVIEW
3.  wallet-service reserves balance      → SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
4.  payment-service writes to outbox     → atomic with payment state change
5.  OutboxRelayService publishes         → fraud-analysis-requested (Kafka)
6.  fraud-service analyzes               → amount > 50,000 BRL → REJECTED
7.  payment-service receives result      → settle or release wallet balance
8.  payment-service writes approved/rejected to outbox
9.  notification-service consumes        → email simulation
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker 24+, Docker Compose v2

```bash
# Clone and start infrastructure + all services
cd infra/docker
docker compose up -d

# Start observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Zipkin)
docker compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d
```

### Test the full flow

```bash
# 1. Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"Password123!"}'

# 2. Login → get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"Password123!"}' | jq -r .accessToken)

# 3. Create wallet
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/wallets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"<your-uuid>","initialBalance":5000,"currency":"BRL"}'

# 4. Create payment (async — fraud analysis kicks in via Kafka)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"payeeId":"<payee-uuid>","amount":500,"currency":"BRL","idempotencyKey":"pay-001"}'

# 5. Poll until APPROVED
curl http://localhost:8080/api/payments/<payment-id> -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Start infrastructure only
cd infra/docker
docker compose up -d postgres redis kafka zookeeper kafka-init

# Run any service
./gradlew :auth-service:bootRun
./gradlew :payment-service:bootRun
```

## Architecture Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-microservices-architecture.md) | Microservices | Independent scaling, fault isolation, team autonomy |
| [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-kafka-event-driven-communication.md) | Kafka messaging | Durable, replayable, decoupled async communication |
| [ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-saga-pattern.md) | Choreography Saga | No central orchestrator, services remain autonomous |
| [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-outbox-pattern.md) | Transactional Outbox | Atomic DB write + event publish, no dual-write risk |
| [ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-observability-stack.md) | Micrometer + Zipkin + Grafana | Unified tracing/metrics with minimal config overhead |

## Trade-offs & Design Decisions

**At-least-once delivery:** Kafka guarantees at-least-once. Every consumer implements idempotency — fraud-service checks `findByPaymentId`, wallet-service checks `existsByPaymentIdAndType` before applying mutations.

**Eventual consistency:** Payment status is PENDING_FRAUD_REVIEW for ~1s after creation. The system is eventually consistent — GET /payments/{id} may return PENDING briefly before the fraud pipeline completes.

**Synchronous wallet calls:** wallet-service is called synchronously from payment-service for balance reservation. This keeps the "available balance" response instant and avoids the complexity of async balance queries. The trade-off is: if wallet-service is down, payments fail immediately rather than queuing.

**Single PostgreSQL instance, multiple schemas:** For a portfolio project, schema isolation (not DB isolation) is used. In production with higher scale, each service would have a dedicated PostgreSQL cluster with connection pooling (PgBouncer).

**Fraud threshold is static:** The fraud engine uses a fixed threshold (50,000 BRL). In production this would be a configurable rule engine or ML model — the interface (`FraudAnalysisService.evaluate()`) is designed for easy extension.

---

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal scaling:** All services are stateless. Scale by increasing container replicas.
- **Kafka partitioning:** 6 partitions per high-volume topic supports 6 concurrent consumers per group. Increase partitions before scaling consumers past 6.
- **Outbox relay:** Multiple relay instances are safe due to `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — each instance claims a disjoint batch.
- **Wallet locking:** Pessimistic write locks are held for the duration of the balance mutation (< 5ms). Under high concurrency, this serializes writes per wallet — acceptable for a single-user wallet model.

---

## Security Considerations

- JWT access tokens expire in 15 minutes; refresh tokens in 7 days
- Refresh tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes — raw tokens never persisted
- API Gateway strips all `X-User-*` inbound headers before routing — prevents header injection
- BCrypt cost factor 10 for password hashing
- Schema-level DB isolation prevents cross-service data access

---

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push:
1. Sets up JDK 21 (Temurin) and Gradle 8.11.1
2. Runs all unit and integration tests (`gradle test`)
3. Builds all service JARs (`gradle bootJar`)
4. Uploads test reports as artifacts (14-day retention)

---

## Roadmap

- [x] Phase 1 — Infrastructure, API Gateway, Auth Service
- [x] Phase 2 — Payment Service, Wallet Service (synchronous flow)
- [x] Phase 3 — Kafka async pipeline: Fraud, Notification
- [x] Phase 4 — Transactional Outbox, Wallet Idempotency, ExponentialBackOff retry
- [x] Phase 5 — OpenTelemetry tracing, Micrometer custom metrics, Grafana dashboards
- [x] Phase 6 — GitHub Actions CI, OpenAPI/Swagger, Mermaid diagrams, graceful shutdown
- [x] Phase 7 — Audit Service (immutable log) + Kubernetes manifests (HPA, PDB, Ingress)
